System Goals -

- Allow users to run Stress for  a set of parameters for the command line tool or ui
- persists Stress run information permanently so that it can be used to generate statistics in the future
- after Stress is run, it should present users with run stats like total items ran, failed, success, with diff,
w/o diff, time taken, file names, file size, etc.
- i/p parameters for the Stress are:
    parent ids, item ids, item types, file types, item versions, status and other parameters
- after the Stress users should be able to see the side-by-side or line-by-line differences between original
version of a data set and revised version of a data set
- Stress could be run against any data set like files (pdf, txt, csv, xls(x), jpeg, jpg, mht, doc(x), ppt(x), etc.)
- users should be able to track the Stress progress on the ui or command line

Stress Tool -
Source (Generate) -> Extract (Apache Tika) -> Diff (java-diff-utils) -> Show (diff2html)

Stress Interface:

Types of Stress: systems1, systems2, systems3

List of Stress: All(10), Completed(8), Running(1), Failed(1)

Inside a Stress:
- Stress title:
- Stress type: systems1 | systems2 | systems3
- original codebase: current version
- revised codebase: revised version

Stress info:
stress_id, ran_by, started_at, finished_at, time_taken, targeted_items(100),
completed(<count>), running(<count>), yet_to_run(<count>), failed(<count>), with_diff(<count>),
without_diff(<count>)
